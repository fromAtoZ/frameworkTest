2.2. In accordance with the NDEV Mobile Program and payment of the applicable fees, you may extend the number of unique devices, increase the daily transaction volume, or extend the Term of the Agreement, as provided in Section 2.1above.

Neither party shall disclose or use the other partyâs Confidential Information (as defined below) except as provided in this Agreement while this Agreement is in effect and for three years following termination or expiration of this Agreement; provided, however, that the foregoing restriction shall be perpetual as to all software. A party may disclose Confidential Information to its agents or employees who have a need to know and who are bound in writing by confidentiality terms no less restrictive than those contained herein.

6. FEES AND TAXES.
6.1. FEES. In consideration for the license rights granted in Section 2, you agree pay the fees for the Service, if any, as you select via the NDEV Mobile Program. You acknowledge and agree that such fees are non-refundable and that once such fees are exhausted based on your use of the Service or expiration of the Term, Nuance will have no obligation to provide the Service to you.

NUANCE PROVIDES THE SOFTWARE, ACCESS METHOD, AND SERVICE âAS IS,â WITH ALL FAULTS, AND WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NUANCE SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMS ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT.

9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

10. TERMINATION. This Agreement begins on your acceptance of the terms and conditions of this Agreement and expires upon the expiration of the Term, unless otherwise terminated herein. Nuance may terminate this Agreement, and the license granted hereunder, at any time in its sole discretion, with or without cause, by notifying you that the Service has been terminated, provided that Nuance may not terminate without cause with respect to a Term for which you have paid fees until exhaustion of such fee, except as otherwise provided under the NDEV Mobile Program. This Agreement shall terminate automatically upon the breach of any of its terms and conditions by you. Upon termination, you shall immediately stop use of and shall delete all copies of the Software and/or Access Method, as applicable.

11. EXPORT COMPLIANCE.

(Nasdaq: NUAN)â

14. TRADEMARKS. Third-party trademarks, trade names, product names and logos (the "Trademarks") contained in or used by the Software or Service are the trademarks or registered trademarks of their respective owners, and the use of such Trademarks shall inure to the benefit of the trademark owner. The use of such Trademarks is intended to denote interoperability and does not constitute: (i) an affiliation by Nuance with such company, or (ii) an endorsement or approval of such company of Nuance and its products or services.

15. GOVERNING LAW. This agreement and any action related thereto shall be governed by the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, United States of America, without regard to its conflicts of laws principles, and you hereby submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal and state courts in said Commonwealth in connection with any dispute arising out of this Agreement. This Agreement shall not be governed by the United Nations Convention of Contracts for the International Sale of Goods, the application of which is hereby expressly excluded.

16. TERMS SUBJECT TO CHANGE. You acknowledge and agree that Nuance may change the terms and conditions of this Agreement from time to time upon 
reasonable notice to the address you provided upon signup, including to your email address. If you do not agree to such changes in this Agreement, your only remedy is to cease using the Software, Access Method, and/or and Service. Your continued use of any part of the Software, Access Method, and/or Service after Nuance has provided you with reasonable notice of such change for your review will be considered your acceptance of such change.

17. GENERAL LEGAL TERMS. You may not assign or otherwise transfer any rights or obligations under this Agreement without Nuanceâs prior written consent. This Agreement is the entire agreement between Nuance and you and supersedes any other communications or advertising with respect to the Software, Access Method, and Service. If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable, such provision shall be revised to the extent necessary to cure the invalidity or unenforceability, and the remainder of this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect. The failure of Nuance to exercise or enforce any right or provision of this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. Sections 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 15 and 17 of this Agreement shall survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement.
